# Hydra Discord Nitro Sniper

![Hydra Banner](https://i.imgur.com/K2cQRhZ.png)

Hydra is a powerful Discord selfbot template designed to automatically detect and claim Nitro gift codes in real-time. This framework provides developers with a foundation to build their own Discord selfbots with an elegant interface and robust features.

## üîç How It Works

Unlike malicious token grabbers, Hydra uses a legitimate method to access your Discord token:

1. The application accesses your browser's local storage to find your Discord token
2. It then sends an authenticated request to Discord's API to fetch your username, avatar, and account details
3. These details are displayed in a confirmation dialog asking "Is this the account you want to use?"
4. Only after confirmation will the selfbot load and connect to Discord

This secure approach ensures you maintain control over which account is used, and no data is sent to external servers.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Selfbot Template:** Build your own custom Discord selfbot on top of this framework
